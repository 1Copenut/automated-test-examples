# Selenium Webdriver on Ruby
I read a few articles and decided to give Selenium Webdriver another look. It's got a lot going for it, not the least it's a web standard.

This README will capture links I've used to get up and running with a few Ruby libs:

* `selenium-webdriver`
* `minitest`
* `bundler`

It'll also capture articles and posts about running proper suites and managing local gems.

## Official resources
