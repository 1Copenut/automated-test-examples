# Trying out Cypress.io for e2e testing

## The aims of this project
* Evaluate [Cypress](https://cypress.io) for ease of use in end-to-end testing
* See how quickly I can build out helper functions for specific test types
* Apply findings to a simple web server, maybe [Express](https://expressjs.com)
